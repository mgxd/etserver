# Migas

Migas is a telemetry web service that collects, aggregates, and displays software usage.

Developers can leverage migas to:
- Monitor software usage, including (somewhat) unique users.
- Communicate with users using legacy/deprecated version.
- Generate interactive graphs with usage statistics.

## NiPreps hosted server

The NiPreps organization hosts [an official instance](https://migas.nipreps.org/) of this service.

For developers wishing to spin-up their own server, please visit the [GitHub wiki](https://github.com/nipreps/migas-server/wiki).


## Usage Monitoring

Authenticated users can view their projects' usage at https://migas.nipreps.org/viz/.
